\section{Preliminaries}
The latest version of this document and the TARQUIN fitting package is available from http://tarquin.sourceforge.net/. Make sure you have the latest version of the software and this guide before continuing as the package is undergoing continual improvement.  TARQUIN is currently available for the Linux and Windows platforms in two versions: the command line version most suitable to batch use and the GUI version most suitable for interactive analyses.  Finally, before using or installing TARQUIN, please read the disclaimer included at the end this document to ensure that the this package is appropriate for your purposes.

\section{Installation}
\subsection{Windows}
The Windows TARQUIN package will be supplied as a zip archive, to install the package download the file, right click on the archive and select ``Extract All...''.  This will create a new ``TARQUIN\_Windows\_\ver'' directory in the current folder.  Within this directory are the following subdirectories : ``basis\_sets'', ``example\_data'' and ``tarquin''.  To run the gui version of TARQUIN open the ``tarquin'' directory and double click on ``tarquingui.exe''.  The command line version can be run by opening the Command Prompt program and running ``tarquin.exe''.

\subsection{Mac OSX}
The OSX version of TARQUIN is bundled as a standard application. The convention is to extract the dmg file and copy the tarquingui bundle to the Applications folder. The bundle also contains the command-line version of tarquin. To use the command line version run the following:

{\tt export PATH=\$PATH:/Applications/tarquingui.app/Contents/MacOS}

This will add the tarquin binaries to the path assuming the tarquingui bundle has been copied the standard Applications folder. This line can also be added to the local .bashrc file to avoid the need to type it every time a new terminal is opened.

\subsection{Linux}
The Linux TARQUIN package will be supplied as a tar.gz archive.  Download the file and open up a terminal.  Navigate to the directory containing the archive and uncompress using the following commands : \\
{\tt cd my\_download\_directory \\
tar -zxvf TARQUIN\_Linux\_\ver.tar.gz} \\
To run the TARQUIN gui enter the ``tarquin'' directory and execute ``tarquingui'' : \\
{\tt cd TARQUIN\_Linux\_\ver/tarquin \\
./tarquingui } \\
the command line version can also be run as follows : \\
{\tt ./tarquin}

\section{GUI User Guide}
\subsection{Quick analysis}
Upon starting the TARQUIN GUI, you will be greeted with a blank plotting window and a menubar located at the top of the window. To perform a basic analysis select ``File'' then ``Quick fit...'' or alternatively press ``q''.  At this point you can select your water suppressed data file and water reference data file where appropriate.  For a first attempt, try to fit the example data included in the ``example\_data'' directory. In this case choose the ``philips\_spar\_sdat\_WS.SDAT'' file as the water suppressed scan and the ``philips\_spar\_sdat\_W.SDAT'' file as the water unsuppressed scan.

TARQUIN will automatically try and guess the format of the data but if this fails then you may be prompted to select the data format manually.  Once the input data is correctly specified select the Fit button.  At this stage TARQUIN will perform the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simulate a PRESS basis set based on the parameters in the data file. 
\item Remove the residual water signal.
\item Perform a preliminary phase estimation.
\item Calibrate the PPM axis based on spectral features.
\item Fit the data.
\end{enumerate}

Steps 2-4 are known as preprocessing.

\subsection{Viewing and saving fit results}
Once the fitting process is completed the concentrations of the measured signals will be displayed, to view the fit plot select ``ok''.  The window should look like Figure \ref{eg_plot} with a plot of the fitted signals and a legend to the right.  Signals can be added and removed from the plot by selecting their names in the legend and selecting two points on the plot with a single left mouse click of the mouse will create a zoom region.  A single right mouse click will return the axes limits to their previous values. Pressing ``x'' or ``y'' will show the full scale in the x and y directions of the plot.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/fit_example.png}
\caption{An example fit plot.}
\label{eg_plot}
\end{figure}

Once the fit has been performed it can be useful to save the results and/or export the signal amplitudes for further analysis. To export the fit as a pdf file select the ``Export plot...''.  The signal amplitudes can also be exported in a formatted text or csv format using the ``Export TXT...'' and ``Export CSV results...'' options respectively from the ``Results'' menu.  Alternatively a table of signal amplitudes can be displayed using by selecting the ``Fitted amplitudes'' option or by pressing the ``r'' key.

\subsection{Advanced analysis}
The quick fit procedure is useful for routine analysis of PRESS data but unsuitable in cases where the default options need to be adjusted.  In these cases the advanced fit dialogue should be opened by selecting ``File'' followed by ``Advanced fit...'' or by pressing the ``a'' key.  A screen shot of the advanced fit dialogue is given in Figure \ref{adv_fit}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/adv_fit.png}
\caption{The advanced fit window.}
\label{adv_fit}
\end{figure}

Unlike the quick fit procedure the data format must be selected prior to selecting the input data files.  Once the data has been successfully read the basic acquisition parameters are displayed in the ``Data Parameters'' tab.  These can be manually edited in case of incorrect parameter detection.  The pulse sequence is assumed to be PRESS but can be easily changed via the ``Pulse sequence'' combination box. Once the correct options have been set, the user can load the data to view without any processing using the ``Load'' button. Alternatively, choosing the ``Fit'' button will perform the analysis and display the results.

If the data was loaded with the ``Load'' button the user can choose to pre-process the data and perform a full analysis using the ``Analysis'' menu in the main window.

\section{Command Line User Guide}
\subsection{Unix-like}
All Unix-like operating systems have access to a terminal application which allows commands to be entered. Finding and running the terminal application is specific to the flavour of Unix you are using, but should be simple enough.  If you are new to the Unix command line and would like some help, http://linuxcommand.org is a decent place to start.

Once you have installed TARQUIN it is recommended (for convenience) that the location of the tarquin binary is on your path.  This means that typing \texttt{tarquin} on the command line should start the program irrespective of the current working directory.  To do this on a temporary basis type the following at the command line:
\\
\\
\texttt{export PATH=\$PATH:your\_path\_to\_binary}
\\
\\
To add the path automatically each time a terminal is opened, add the line to the .bashrc file located in your home directory.

%\subsection{Windows}

\subsection{Example Usage}
The command line version of TARQUIN requires the used to specify options to the software using a series of arguments to the main program.  The options are specified in the following way:
\\
\\
\noindent
\texttt{tarquin ---option1 value1 ---option2 value2 ---option3 value3...}
\\
\\
An example command follows which will fit the \texttt{WS.ima} data file using \texttt{W.ima} as a water reference file.  The data format is specified to be Siemens ima and a text file of results is outputted.  A path to the csv basis set is also supplied.
\\
\\
\noindent
\texttt{tarquin ---input WS.ima ---input\_w W.ima ---format siemens}

\noindent
\texttt{---basis\_csv .\//path\_to\_basis ---output\_txt results.txt}

\subsection{Automated Analysis}
Since TARQUIN analyses can be performed from the command line, the batch analysis of spectra can be performed with the aid of a scripting language.  If you are using a Unix-like OS and have some experience with the command line then bash is a good scripting language to start with.  However bash can be a little awkward to use in Windows, so an example using Python will be given as it is cross-platform and clear to read.  Instructions on how to install and use Python can be found from www.python.org.

The following code listing gives an example of how a script to automatically analyse MRS data may look:
\begin{verbatim}
#!/bin/python

import os
import sys
import re

format = 'siemens'
dir = '/home/tarquin/Desktop'
pattern = '.*MRS$'

# find all files in the dir
fileList = []
for root, subFolders, files in os.walk(dir):
    for file in files:
       fileList.append(os.path.join(root,file))

# find files that match the regex pattarn
fileListMatch = []
for file in fileList:
    if re.search(pattern,file):
        fileListMatch.append(file)

# for each matched file
for file in fileListMatch:
    command = ('tarquin --input ' + file + ' --format ' + format + 
        --output_pdf ' + file + '.pdf' + ' --output_txt ' + file + '.txt')
    # run the command
    os.system(command)
\end{verbatim}
This script recursively searches for all files within in the \texttt{dir} variable.  Each file that ends with the letters \texttt{MRS} is considered to be a data file and is stored in the \texttt{fileListMatch} vector.  TARQUIN is then run on each data file, using the default brain basis set, assuming the data is in the Siemens format.  TARQUIN outputs a pdf plot of the fit and a text file containing the metabolite quantities with the same name at the data file appended with the extensions .pdf and .txt respectively.  Where the analysis of large datasets is required, scripting can be a very useful tool for saving you a huge amount of time and wrist strain!

\section{Data types}
\subsection{PRESS}
\subsubsection{Timings and simulation}
The standard PRESS sequence consists of two spin echoes, known as TE1 and TE2, and the summation of these times is equal to the total echo-time TE. To get the most accurate results, the simulation routine needs to know the correct TE1 and TE for your data, TE2 is determined from TE-TE1. The default TE1 can vary between manufacturers and also for different pulse shapes so it is worth finding out what pulse timings your system is using.

\subsubsection{Chemical shift displacement}
Chemical shift displacement (CSD) is an issue for all localisation methods that use the combination of an RF pulse and gradient to perform selective excitation. Generally the effects are small, however for PRESS at high field (3T or greater) CSD can become a problem \cite{CSD}. The current TARQUIN simulation routine does not take into account the influence of CSD on metabolite signals \cite{high_f_sims}, therefore if CSD is significant your results may be biased.

\subsection{High-field/rodent}
You will most likely need to reduce the ``Start point'' parameter in the ``Fitting'' tab in the advanced fit dialogue.  The equivalent command line parameter is ``start\_pnt''. TARQUIN tries to guess a decent value but if your shim or SNR is poor the fit may benefit from a lower value.

\subsection{MEGA-PRESS}
A basic MEGA-PRESS analysis to estimate the concentration of GABA can be performed using TARQUIN. To perform analysis using the gui take the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the advanced fit dialogue and specify the input data in the usual way.
\item In the ``Data Parameters'' tab set the pulse sequence to ``MEGA-PRESS''. Note, this isn't a true MEGA-PRESS simulation but rather tells TARQUIN that the auto-phasing algorithm needs to expect a large negative peak.
\item To correct for frequency drift tick `Dynamic freq. correction'' and set ``Dynamic corr. ref. signals'' to ``1H Cr Cho'' or ``1H H2O'' depending on whether you have a stable residual water peak. If you choose to try this optional step always compare your results to those without the correction, this step should improve SNR/lineshape but if the scans are noisy it may degrade quality. Note, this is only worth trying if you data has been collected dynamically.
\item In the ``Preprocessing'' tab set ``Reference signals'' to ``1H NAA''. Because NAA is a prominent singlet it can be used to help the optimiser find a good value for the linewidth.
\item In the ``Fitting'' tab change the ``Start point'' to be around 10 if your sampling frequency is around 2000.
\item In the ``Fitting'' tab set ``Internal basis set'' to ``1H MEGA-PRESS GABA'' to generate a basic model of the important peaks.
\end{enumerate}

GABA is modelled as two separate peaks GABA\_A and GABA\_B, the amplitudes of these should be summed to give an estimate of the overall amount of GABA.  Note, water scaling is still performed as described in section \ref{ws} which is unlikely to be correct for MEGA-PRESS. No attempt is made to separate GABA from macromolecules at 3ppm.

Depending on how the sequence was implemented, the ``Dynamic averaging'' scheme in the ``Data Parameters'' tab may need to be set to ``Subtract even from odd'' to get a correctly combined MEGA-PRESS spectrum.

Edit on and off scans can be visualised/analysed separately by changing the ``Dynamic averaging'' scheme which can be useful for getting ratios to creatine or measuring glutmaine. Furthermore, individual dynamic scans can be processed by setting the averaging scheme to ``No averaging''. Flicking through the individual scans with an eye on peak positions can be useful for detecting motion or field drift.

\section{Data formats}
\subsection{GE p-files}
TARQUIN will read GE SVS p-files and combine data from multi-coil arrays where appropriate. A single phase factor (per coil) is applied to data from each coil before combination. Where water unsuppressed data is available this factor is taken from the phase of the first data point in the first unsuppressed frame. Where only water suppressed data is available, this phase factor is taken from the first data point in the first suppressed frame.

%\section{Fitting Details}
%The main algorithmic details and validation is described in the following paper: \cite{tarquin_paper}.  Any expansions and changes to the original algorithm will be described in the following section.

\section{Basis sets}

\subsection{Exporting LCModel .basis files}
The gui and command line (option \texttt{---output\_basis\_lcm}) versions may be used to export basis sets into a format that may be used with LCModel. By default, LCModel uses the CH3 signal from creatine to automatically scale the basis set. This frequency-domain calculation may be sensitive to signal truncation issues. Therefore when a simulated basis set is exported, the simulation is performed twice, once for the TARQUIN analysis and once for the .basis export. To avoid signal truncation errors in the LCModel basis scaling, a larger number of points to export may be specified using the \texttt{---lcm\_basis\_pts} parameter (4096 by default).

TARQUIN will not export the lipid, macromolecule or inverted CH2 creatine signals.

\subsection{Importing LCModel .basis files}
The gui and command line (option \texttt{---basis\_lcm}) versions may be used to import basis sets generated by TARQUIN or other MRS alysis packages. The basis file field strength, echo time, sampling frequency (dwell time) must all match the MRS data undergoing analysis. Where the number of points differ between the basis set and MRS data, TARQUIN will truncate or zero-fill as appropriate.

It is assumed that all metabolites in the basis file are scaled consistently and at the correct frequency (ISHIFT is ignored). It is also assumed that the signals are completely ``clean'' with no residual water or reference signals present. The centre frequency is assumed to be 4.65PPM. Finally, the basis set is not automatically scaled so this adjustment needs to be applied manually (contact me if you want to do this but don't know how or why). Whilst in principle it is possible to use experimental basis sets with TARQUIN using the .basis format, data will need to be filtered, scaled and shifted first. Simulated basis sets will be much simpler to import as these corrections are generally not required.

TARQUIN will append the lipid, macromolecule or inverted CH2 creatine signals to an imported .basis file.

\section{Absolute quantitation and water scaling}
\label{ws}
If an unsuppressed water signal is specified in TARQUIN the resulting metabolite amplitudes will be scaled to be in units of mM.  The following section describes how this is performed and what assumptions are made.
The following equation describes the relationship between the concentration of a molecule and its MRS signal:
\begin{equation}
signal_{conc} = \frac{C * signal_{amp}}{signal_{protons}}
\end{equation}
where $signal_{conc}$, $signal_{amp}$ and $signal_{protons}$ represent the concentration, amplitude and number of contributing protons of a particular signal. The constant $C$ is an unknown scaling factor. Since $signal_{protons}$ is accounted for by the simulation routine it can be disregarded from the following analysis.

The same relationship is true of water, however an attenuation factor $water_{att}$ may be required to account for the reduction of the water signal relative to the metabolites signals due to differences in T2 relaxation.
\begin{equation}
water_{conc} = \frac{C * water_{amp}}{water_{protons} * water_{att}}
\end{equation}

Since we know the water signal originates from two protons, $water_{protons}$ will be set to two.  Taking the previous two equations and substituting $C$ allows $signal_{conc}$ to be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
signal_{conc} = \frac{signal_{amp} * water_{conc} * water_{att} * 2}{water_{amp}}
\end{equation}

$signal_{amp}$ and $water_{conc}$ are calculated from the data. $water_{att}$ is assumed to be a constant and can be estimated from the $T_2$'s of water and metabolites as follows:

\begin{equation}
water_{att} = \frac{\exp(-t/T_2^{water})}{\exp(-t/T_2^{signal})}
\end{equation}

At 1.5T the T2 of water is approximately 80ms, and metabolites are around 400ms (although considerable variation exists between metabolite resonances). Further T2 estimates can be found in the following references \cite{metab_t2_3t,water_relaxation}. For an echo time of 30ms the correction factor can be calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
water_{att} = \frac{\exp(-30/80)}{\exp(-30/400)} \approx 0.7
\end{equation}
Therefore the default value of $water_{att}$ is therefore 0.7 and should be modified for longer/shorter echo times or different field strengths. $water_{conc}$ represents the NMR visible water concentration (mM) and has a default value of 35880 which assumes a white matter value. 43300 and 55556 should be used for grey matter and phantoms respectively. A more in-depth discussion of the assumptions made is described in papers by Ernst et al \cite{water_ref} and Gasparovic et al \cite{csi_water_ref}.


\section{Troubleshooting}
\subsection{The baseline is unrealistic and the fit looks poor}
Try reducing the ``Start point'' parameter in the ``Fitting'' tab in the advanced fit dialogue.  The equivalent command line parameter is ``start\_pnt''. TARQUIN tries to guess a decent value but if your shim or SNR is poor the fit may benefit from a lower value.

\subsection{The basis set looks wrong}
Double check the echo time and ensure you are entering the correct value in seconds (not milliseconds) when the data is loaded.

\subsection{The ppm scale looks incorrect}
This can happen in phantom studies where the assumption that the water peak is around 4.7ppm fails. Try adjusting the ref parameter in the advanced fit dialogue.
