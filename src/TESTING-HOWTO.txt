The testing suite is just a program, built like any other program in the build tree. So first you need to build everything:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 8

Then you need to "make install", to build a tree of files which is placed in "build/redist". This rule will copy all the files used for testing.

make install

Finally, you have to run the tests

cd redist
./tarquin_tests
