On Win32 get the following MinGW distribution:

You will need to build fftw3 and get the "technology preview" of gfortran, which then requires some buggering about to make it work (renaming, etc.)

You will need the following Ubuntu packages to build:

fftw3 dev                [for DFTs]
lapack3 dev              [for general linear algebra - this automagically gets BLAS as well]
boost filesystem-dev     [for parsing the directories containing the basis set]
boost dev                [for the tokenizer and other handy things]
boost thead-dev
freeglut3 dev            [for the dependencies of this package, you don't actually need the package]
libwxgtk2.8 dev		 [for the GUI]
libwxbase2.8 dev         [probably don't need it currently, but you almost certainly will at any time in the future]
gfortran
gnuplot                  [for plotting]
colorgcc                 [for nice colour compilation errors]
libfreetype6-dev         [for the GUI]

This command should do it from a fresh Ubuntu install (tested 
with version 8.04.2)

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential lapack3-dev gfortran fftw3-dev libboost-filesystem-dev freeglut-dev libwxgtk2.8-dev libboost-serialization-dev gnuplot colorgcc libfreetype6-dev libboost-thread-dev

This command should do it from a fresh Ubuntu install (tested 
with version 10.04)
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential liblapack-dev gfortran libf2c2-dev libfftw3-dev libprotobuf-dev gnuplot libwxgtk2.8-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev freeglut3-dev libfreetype6-dev

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake liblapack-dev gfortran libf2c2-dev libfftw3-dev libprotobuf-dev gnuplot libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-test-dev libqt4-dev libqwt5-qt4-dev

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake liblapack-dev gfortran libf2c2-dev libfftw3-dev gnuplot libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-test-dev libqt4-dev libqwt5-qt4-dev

also need to manually install protobuf 2.3.0, install into /usr to avoid messing about
./configure --prefix=/usr

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake liblapack-dev gfortran libf2c2-dev libfftw3-dev gnuplot libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-test-dev libqt4-dev libqwt5-qt4-dev

Installation on OSX snow leopard (new instructions)
---------------------------------------------------
install xcode from DVD
install cmake
install gfortran from R package
install protobuf (2.3.0)
install boost - download the tar.gz uncompress:
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./bjam
    sudo ./bjam install
install QT libs (build and interface tools)
install fftw3
install QWT (5.2.1 works)


Installation on OSX snow leopard (old instructions)

install xcode from DVD
compile F2C instructions from : http://hpc.sourceforge.net/ 
change levmar makefile to use f2c rather than g2c
download gfortran from mac hpc
install fftw3 from http://www.fftw.org/download.html
install google protocol buffers

install boost+boost-build via macports
add export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include to bashrc
make sure BOOST vars are as follows in the main Makefile
# Flags for the components of Boost TARQUIN uses.
BOOST_PATH    = /opt/local/include
BOOST_LIB     = /opt/local/lib
BOOST_CFLAGS  = -I$(BOOST_PATH)
BOOST_LDFLAGS = -L$(BOOST_LIB)
BOOST_LDFLAGS += -lboost_filesystem-mt -undefined dynamic_lookup


For the GUI...
install mesa
sudo port install mesa

install freetype
sudo port install freetype
sudo ln -s /opt/local/include/freetype2/freetype /opt/local/include/freetype
sudo port install ftgl <- may not be needed

install wxwidgets
sudo port install wxWidgets-devel
