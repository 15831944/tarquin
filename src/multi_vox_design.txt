Plan for adding multi-voxel fitting support:

1. Make m_cvmFID a vector and make sure that SVS analysis still works. - done
2. Write CSI preprocessing code for Siemens ima data. - done
3. Allow one voxel from a CSI grid to be selected for analysis. - done
4. Allow multiple voxels to be selected for analysis and results to be retrieved. Lots of things will need to be turned into vectors here. - in progress.
5. Make sure that the scaling of results is correct. - done
6. Allow csv export of multivoxel fitting results. - done
7. Allow the user to view the fit results for different voxels.
8. Allow the user to specify which voxels are to be analysed via the gui using text boxes.
9. Parallelise the fitting code for multi-voxel analysis.
10. Make a nice gui grid representation for selecting the voxels to be analysed/fit results shown.
11. Make sure GE, Philips and DICOM MRS can be analysed.
12. Generate color metabolite maps and display with dicom MRI - external application may best here SIVIC?
